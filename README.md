## Ammendments
- opinionated cleaner html using sections
- updates to javasript libraries
- added waypoints navigation highlighting while scrolling
- replaced stellar parallax with skrollr (smoother!)

## To use end edit
- clone or download repo
- cd into dir
- run yarn (or npm install)
- make your style or js changes in resources/assets
- run gulp to publish all assets to the public folder
- check out the Laravel Elixier docs https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/elixir

I highly recommend [Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/valet) for develoment on a Mac.

## To use with Laravel
- merge all into the Laraval structure and move public index.html into your blade views.
