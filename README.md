# Laravel Elixir One-Page Starter Template

based on the 'Concept' template by [http://gettemplates.co]

Preview of the original thanks to [https://freehtml5.co/demos/concept]

I felt like doing this over and over again - even developers need some better looking starting points ;-) that go beyond the standard bootstrap look... so here we go:

## Ammendments
- opinionated cleaner html using sections
- updates to javasript libraries
- added waypoints navigation highlighting while scrolling
- replaced stellar parallax with skrollr (smoother!)

## To use
- clone or download repo
- cd into dir
- run yarn (or npm install)
- run gulp to publish all assets to the public folder

I highly recommend [Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/valet) for develoment on a Mac.

## To use with Laravel
- merge all into the Laraval structure - move public index.html into your blade views and you're ready to go.
